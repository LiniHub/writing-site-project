The Truman Show is all about this. The Truman Show written by Andrew Niccol, directed by Peter Weir and starring Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank.\nPlot # The film shows us Truman Burbank and his fake life in a reality show named \u0026ldquo;The Truman Show\u0026rdquo;. This show films the whole life of Truman from his birth 7/24 live and Truman doesn\u0026rsquo;t know his life is a lie since his birth. But on a normal day he sees his father whom he thought was dead and after that he starts to doubt about his life.\nMy Views # I think Jim Carrey is the chosen one for the Truman Burbank role, he fits in absolutely perfect, the soundtrack is good enough for the movie and the storyline is as gripping as my father\u0026rsquo;s BBQ parties. The Movie has very good quotes and clips around the internet.\nSuggestions # For me The Truman Show is a \u0026ldquo;Must Watch\u0026rdquo; movie for everyone because of today\u0026rsquo;s problems like private life and its protection.\nSayonara # I want to finish this text with the most iconic quotes from the movie.\n\u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;in case I don\u0026rsquo;t see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!\u0026rdquo;\n~Truman Burbank\n","date":"8 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/writing-site-project/classes/prep-b/truman-show/","section":"","summary":"","title":"The Truman Show","type":"classes"},{"content":" Preparetion Class A # This class\u0026rsquo;s class teacher is mustafa gok!
